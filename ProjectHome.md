# Event Log to CEF #

This project is an adaptation of http://code.google.com/p/eventlog-to-syslog/

It reformats Windows event logs into CEF (Common Event Format) for relaying into an Arcsight Syslog Connector. It offers an alternative to Arcsight's Store-Credentials-And-Pull model.

It is an adaption of Curtis Smith's Eventlog to Syslog service found at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/Resources/Documents/UNIX/evtsys/
